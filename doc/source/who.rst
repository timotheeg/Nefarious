* nefarious is made by me, Timoth√©e Groleau, for my own usage. I have no doubt that such an awesome, open source, utility will soon attract hords of eager developers ;)
* nefarious is made in python as a way for me to learn python through a real program. I am in great debt to my friend and colleague Ali who made it somewhat presentable before you had a chance to see it.
* I am normally quite opened minded and thick-skinned, but if you spot some wtf moments while looking at the code, please stay polite is letting me know, you wouldn't want to hurt my feelings now, would you?
