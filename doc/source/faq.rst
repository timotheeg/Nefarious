FAQ

Wait... did you say you were manipulating raw files? That's the greatest sin of digital photography!!!! Haven't you read the memo? NO program should ever touch a raw file!! You should rot in hell, along with all your descendants for 10 generations.
yes. yes. you are a moron.

The "Raw file", is just a tiff file, a bunch of tags to tell you how to read the file itself. What is really precious in that file is the sensor data. nefarious doesn't alter that in any way.

Anything else is fair game: change the date, change/add gps location, update the preview jpeg, whatever. The aim of nefarious is to spit out nef files in such a way that no program, not even from nikon itself, would ever realize the nef was not straight out of a Nikon camera. and of course the ability to actually use the sensor data for editing is fully retained.

Just to be clear though, this program comes with no warranty whatsoever. Clearly, you are a zealot, so by all mean do NOT use my program, it might just give you an ulcer. Here is a better site for you.

Now, if you DO try it, please be a good computer user and:

#. Try first on a few files before running this on your entire image collection. 
#. Do me and yourself a favour and have your data backed up.

Why was that first question?
The first time I submitted the idea of a nef manipulation program to replace the dummy jpeg preview, it was the first reaction I received. Some guy said editing raw files was "a crime". So, the question was relevant as the first of the FAQ because:

it can tell buggers to f%@$ off right away
nefarious is the name chosen because of them
Why the name "nefarious"?
Well,nefarious means nasty, and many people think touching raw files is just that. Additionally, I am manipulating nef files, and well, there is only one word in the oxford dictionary that starts with "nef", and that's nefarious :).

Which nef format/version does nefarious support?
So far nefarious is tested on my own D300S nef files. it knows how to parse a typical tiff file by being aware of which tiff tags represent tiff directories (only 3 in the D300S).
