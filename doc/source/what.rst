nefarious is a python library and utility that lets you manipulate parts of a Nikon NEF file WITHOUT altering the sensor data.
In particular, nefarious allows you to replace the embedded jpeg image preview (typically a full-size, but low-quality, jpeg), by any other replacement image of your choice.
For photographers shooting in RAW+FINE, nefarious will allow the photographer to replace the low-quality jpeg by the HQ jpeg and keeping both resources in one file.
If image processing is involved, nefarious allows the artists to embed the final processed image into the NEF itself.
